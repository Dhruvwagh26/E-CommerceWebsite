# E-CommerceWebsite
This Project is the Second Task assigned to me during my Internship at InternPe.

Description->

The project is an e-commerce website designed specifically for a restaurant, built using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. 
Its primary purpose is to showcase the restaurant's menu items and provide visitors with a platform
to browse and potentially order food online. 
The website consists of multiple pages, including a landing page that introduces the restaurant
and highlights any special offers or promotions. 
Additionally, the main feature of the website is the menu display section, where visitors can explore the variety 
of dishes available, along with their descriptions and possibly prices. 
The project aims to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that enhances the online dining 
experience for customers, making it convenient for them to browse the menu and place orders 
from the comfort of their homes.
